1. Create the map with dimensions, with obstacles
2. Set goal states for each drone
3. Start listening for start states; input: a packet of start states for each drone
	3a. Store start states in an array of packets (objects)... [{{a_i, state}, {a_j, state}, {a_k, state}}, ..]

4. For each agent, call path planning algo for their respective start states

Drone drifting fix:
- use negative feedback to tell the drone to go back to its path, using IP positions
